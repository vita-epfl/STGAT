# STGAT: Modeling Spatial-Temporal Interactions for Human Trajectory Prediction
This is code for **STGAT: Modeling Spatial-Temporal Interactions for Human Trajectory Prediction**
editted for evaluation on the ETH-UCY split sampled according to TrajNet++ procedure and TrajNet++ benchmark.

TrajNet++ sampling allows to focus on pedestrians of interest that undergo social interactions, while ignoring non-essential trajectories like static trajectories.

## Requirements
* Python 3
* PyTorch (1.2)
* Matplotlib



## Scripts

`cd STGAT`

Refer to Makefile for training and evaluation scripts.
